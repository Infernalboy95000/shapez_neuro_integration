                Welcome to shapez. Your current goal is to deliver 30 uncolored sphere shapes to the HUB.<br><br>
                <strong>Scan terrain</stong> to find a sphere shape patch.

            1_0_deep_scan: >-
                <strong>Deep scan</strong> the patch you just found!<br><br>
                This will tell you exactly where you can extract the spahes.

            1_1_extractor: >-
                Place an <strong>extractor</strong> on top of an <strong>uncolored sphere shape patch</strong> to extract it!

            1_2_conveyor: >-
                Connect the extractor with a <strong>conveyor belt</strong> to your hub!<br><br>
                Tip:<strong>Scan</strong> buildings to find where the hub is!<br><br>
                Tip2: Use the <strong>belt planner</strong> to connect the miner to the hub with belts.

            1_3_expand: >-
                This is <strong>NOT</strong> an idle game! Build more extractors and belts to finish the goal quicker.<br><br>Tip: Place <strong>lines of extractors</strong> and face them in the
                <strong>right direction</strong>.

            2_1_place_cutter: >-
                Now place a <strong>Cutter</strong> to cut the circles in two halves!<br><br>
                PS: The cutter always cuts from <strong>top to bottom</strong> regardless of its orientation.

            2_2_place_trash: >-
                The cutter can <strong>clog and stall</strong>!<br><br>
                Use a <strong>trash</strong> to get rid of the currently (!) not needed waste.

            2_3_more_cutters: >-
                Good job! Now place <strong>2 more cutters</strong> to speed up this slow process!

            3_1_rectangles: >-
                Now let's extract some rectangles! <strong>Build 4 extractors</strong> and connect them to the hub.<br><br>
                PS: Place a <strong>line of belts</strong>!

            21_1_place_quad_painter: >-
                Place the <strong>quad painter</strong> and get some <strong>circles</strong>, <strong>white</strong> and <strong>red</strong> color!

            21_2_switch_to_wires: >-
                Switch to the wires layer by pressing <strong>E</strong>!<br><br>
                Then <strong>connect all four inputs</strong> of the painter with cables!

            21_3_place_button: >-
                Awesome! Now place a <strong>Switch</strong> and connect it with wires!

            21_4_press_button: >-
                Press the switch to make it <strong>emit a truthy signal</strong> and thus activate the painter.<br><br>
                PS: You don't have to connect all inputs! Try wiring only two.

            1_2_hold_and_drag: You can do it!
